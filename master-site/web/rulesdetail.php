<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Muted by another Player</b><br>
1] If another player has muted you, do NOT attempt to contact them in any other way.<br>
2] Do not ask friends to contact the player who has muted you, this validates as harassment.<br>
3] There is a good reason why another player muted you.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Personally Muting Other Players</b><br>
1] If another player is bothering you, making you angry or upset in any way please use the Personal Mute feature, do <b>not</b> respond in a harsh or rude manner, please simply just Personally Mute the player to avoid conflict or stress to yourself. <br>
2] You can use this feature by clicking the "PLAYERS" button (next to the "HORSES" button which you use to view your horses), and by clicking "List Players Alphabetically". Next to the player's name you will see a "MUTE" button, click it. <br>
3] Players <b>cannot</b> do the following when they are muted by you: Throwing items at you, contacting you in any way (e.g.: by sending you mail), by engaging in socials, etc.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Muted by a Moderator</b><br>
1] Muting is a form of punishment used by Moderators or Admins in order to try and stop a specific action performed by a player. <br>
2] Being muted results in ALL of your chats being barred from use by a player for a given period of time depending on severity.<br>
3] If you are muted, you will be notified as to what you did wrong and for how long you were muted, you will also gain violation points accordingly.<br>
4] If you have been muted, please accept that you have broken a rule - please do not argue as to why you have been muted. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Moderators</b><br>
1] A Horse Isle Moderator is someone who is enabled to enforce the rules of Horse Isle - someone who mediates disputes and attempts to avoid conflict.<br>
2] Players cannot ask to become a moderator, the site Admins will look for helpful players meeting requirements on their own.<br>
3] Moderators are in place in order to enforce rules and keep the game <b>enjoyable</b> for all.<br>
4] Always ensure that you listen carefully to a Horse Isle Moderator. Moderators speak in GREEN text on the Global chat, and have [mod] beside their name when they send you a Personal Message.<br>
5] <b>NOTE:</b> If you feel that a Moderator is treating you unfairly in any way, please file a legitimate Abuse Report.<br>
6] Players who are <b>not</b> Moderators: Please do <b>not</b> attempt to correct other players who have broken a rule - this only singles out the player in question.&nbsp; This is a Moderator's job, and not at all expected of you. <br>
7] Most of the time you will <b>not</b> see a Moderator correcting or warning a player - Moderators correct, or warn using a <b>Personal Message</b> - Please do not assume a Moderator is not dealing with a problem.<br>
8] Friends of Moderators: Please do <b>NOT</b> at any time expect any special treatment towards yourself.&nbsp; You are NOT excluded from the rules, and if you are violating a rule, the Moderator is <b>expected</b> to take action immediately. Moderators giving their friends special treatment will have their status removed.<br>
9] Moderators are not required to help other players - Moderators are players like everyone else. Sometimes they are busy, or working on their own things and Moderators are under <b>no obligation</b> to help. DO NOT be upset when they do not have time to help you, and be grateful when they do. Try making your requests for help to anyone on the server if it's a general game issue.<br>
10] Moderators will NOT send you to Prison Isle for free, please do not ask. <br>
11] If a Moderator tells you that something is a rule, then it's a rule and you need to follow it, whether you can find it in the rules or not.  Moderators do not make up rules.  If you have a serious concern that a Moderator is making things up, feel free to contact support, however, still do as asked.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Multiple Accounts</b><br>
1] Owning more than one account per player is strictly against the rules and is considered cheating. <br>
2] If you have more than one person using the same computer for different accounts, please notify an Admin using the CONTACT US link, and take note of the following:<br>
<b>ONE FREE PLAYER PER HOUSEHOLD PER SERVER LIMIT ADDED:</b> This has unfortunately been
necessary because of all of the cheating. From now on, Only One Free player can connect to a certain server. Example 1: If Players A and B neither subscribe, and both play on Pinto, Now one of them will have to start playing on a different server or subscribe. Example 2: If Player A and B are subscribed to pinto and player C plays on Pinto for free, all 3 will be fine. We are sorry we had to make this change, but way too much of our time has been wasted by free players cheating, So we hope everyone can understand. <br>
3] If you already own more than one account, please notify an Admin immediately, to have it deleted. Failure to do so will result in both accounts being deleted and all of your items lost. <br>
4] A Multiple account is when you sign up for more than one playername; e.g.: JackFrost, JackFrostOne, JackFrostTwo, etc. Signing up to another server with your same Playername is not a multiple account.</font></p><p>

1] Netiquette is commonly known as Internet Etiquette.<br>
2] Here are some things you should do: Avoid hurting someone's feelings; Respect other people's online rights; Avoid insulting someone; If someone insults you, be calm and do not respond.<br>
3] Remember that there are people behind the Playernames on Horse Isle, and that sometimes real life does get in the way of Playtime.<br>
4] That being said, you cannot predict when a specific player will be online, and therefore can never expect them to be online at a certain time.<br>
5] Remember <b>NOT</b> to expect another Player to reply to you absolutely immediately if you have sent them a Personal Message - sometimes people are away from the computer for a small while, and therefore cannot respond.<br>
6] Do not get upset if another Player does not respond, there could be many reasons for that, be patient.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Island Passwords</b><br>
1] Please do NOT discuss island passwords in chat where others may overhear. Please do NOT ask them on any other chat than by using Personal Message.<br>
2] This rule is in order because it ruins the fun for other players. Players should find these passwords themselves, as it makes the game more challenging. <br>
3] If the passwords are shared on a Public chat, the password will be changed, and players will once again have to get the passwords from the residents.<br>
4] An acceptable way to ask for help with passwords on global would be <i>"Please PM me if you can help with a password."</i><br>
5] Please do NOT post the actual riddle for the password in any public chat asking for answers, even though you intend that the answer is sent by Personal Message to you - most likely the answer will end up in the chat which you have posted the riddle in. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Account Passwords</b><br>
1] Please do NOT share your Horse Isle password! NO ONE from Horse Isle staff will ever ask it from you.<br>

3] Never ever share your password with ANYONE. <br>
4] You should change your password frequently in order to prevent hacking, you can change it by going to hi1.horseisle.com and clicking the "<b>SERVER LIST</b>" page. Scroll down to the bottom and click "<b>Account Settings: <a href="/web/accountchange.php">CHANGE MY PASSWORD</a></b>".<br>
5] ALWAYS ensure that all of your passwords are Alphanumerical (Numbers AND Letters) and are <b>longer</b> than 8 characters.<br>
6] If you choose not to heed these warnings - be aware that if you are hacked then it is your own responsibility. We cannot refund any account values if you have lost them due to password abuse.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Pawneer</b><br>
1] When selling a horse, please do not use the pawneer as a threat.<br>
2] Doing so will result in a warning.&nbsp; If you want to pawn the horse please go ahead, but if you expect to sell it, do <b>NOT</b> mention the pawneer please. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Personal Information</b><br>

10] Limit your contact and friendships to IN-GAME only. This is for your and other peoples' safety.<br>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Pricing of Horses</b><br>
1] If you ask another player for advice on pricing your horses, do NOT hold that player responsible for any false advice given.&nbsp; This is your responsibility to price accordingly.<br>
2] Please do not comment in any way about another player's pricing of horses or items - this is their business and their choice. <br>
3] Please do not <b>beg</b> other players to help you in the pricing of your horse - this is your responsibility, not theirs.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Players</b><br>

opinions, etc. keep most conversation focus on Horse Isle itself.&nbsp; Remember to be aware of this fact when bringing topics regarding a certain country/state into play. <br>
2] No harassing/bullying other players. Do Not tease, make fun of, call names, etc. The old, <i>"if you don't have anything nice to say.. don't type."</i></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Private Auctions</b><br>
1]Private Auctions are any auction held by a player and not in the auction block provided on Horse Isle.  These are not endorsed by Horse Isle.  We recommend you do not hold or partake in these.<br>
2]We realize that only horses can be auctioned at the auction blocks.  If you feel you must hold a private auction for items, you may.  However, if there are complaints or reports of scamming, you may be asked to stop.<br>
3]Private auctions are not controlled at all.  It is possible for the auction holder to lie about the highest bid.  It is also possible for players to bid more money than they have.  If you find this is the case, please file an Abuse Report on the player immediately and let a moderator know if one is online.<br>
4]If asked to stop holding an auction by a moderator, please do so immediately.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Punctuation</b><br>
1] Please be careful when using an excessive amount of punctuation. e.g.: <i>"Hi I Would like a horse soo badly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you help me??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????"</i><br>
2] Players consider excessive use of punctuation annoying.&nbsp; Please avoid it whenever possible.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Profiles</b><br>
1] All game rules apply to profiles.<br>
2] Please do not add ANY of the above rule breaking Personal Information - you <b>will</b> be asked to remove it or it <b>will</b> be
forcibly removed.<br>
3] Please avoid controversial and religious topics or clubs within your profile.<br>
4] No words that are changed in chat are allowed in descriptions or horse names.  Just because a word that is normally changed in chat is not changed in profiles, doesn't mean it's okay for it to be there.<br>
5] Please ensure that ALL content in your profile is in the English language.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Pity Ploys in Order to Gain Horse Isle Items</b><br>
1] The definition of Pity: "sympathetic or kindly sorrow evoked by the suffering, distress, or misfortune of another, often leading one to give relief or aid or to show mercy;  a cause or reason for pity, sorrow, or regret." ( Dictionary.com)<br>
2] Please do NOT ask for items using pity as an excuse to engage in begging. <br>
3] Remember to try and keep personal misfortunes to yourself.<br>
4] If you absolutely must share your misfortunes, or need someone to talk to, that is okay, but please do NOT deliberately ask for things because of something bad that has happened. <br>
5] Don't share too many personal problems.&nbsp; This is a game and not a consultancy. <br>
6] Please do not consistently bring up the same topic - if you have already discussed the topic, please do not bring it up again, this can be annoying to other players.<br>
7] Ensure that your topic, if you must share, is NOT inappropriate and <b>is within the rules</b>.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Player Politeness</b><br>
1] Remember that being nice and polite makes the game enjoyable for everyone.<br>
2] Remember that being rude about something will most likely make another unwilling to help you, or will cause a fight between players.<br>
3] If you are polite in your demeanor (If you are friendly and nice), other players will be MORE willing to talk to you and help you. <br>
4] Very few people enjoy sarcasm - if you feel the need to be sarcastic, ensure that you make a joke about it, and ensure it is in the right context - misunderstandings do frequently occur when players use sarcasm.</font></p><p>

4] To have your account deleted so that you can start over, contact support@horseisle.com from the email address you used to create your account.

5] Please do NOT post the actual riddle in any public chat asking for answers, even though you intend that the answer is sent by Personal Message to you - most likely the answer will end up in the chat which you have posted the riddle in. </font></p><p>

4] Please be aware of this when creating a profile.  There is no need to have any religious references in a profile.  This even includes mentioning what religion you are.  There is no reason others need to know what religion you are.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Racial</b><br>
1] Please do NOT refer to any racial comments at all - there are many different players here of many different ethnicities, and respect is due to them all. <br>
2] It is not advisable to bring up any topic directly related to ethnicity, arguments could occur.</font></p><p>

1] The definition of a Raffle: "a form of lottery in which a number of persons buy one or more chances to win a prize." <br>
2] Raffles and contests where you must pay to enter are strictly against the rules. <br>
3] Raffles are a form of gambling, which we do not allow in the game.<br>
4] If you see a player holding a raffle or paying contest, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Role Playing</b><br>
1] We do not advise that you engage in Role Playing of any kind within the game.  There are many sites out there specific for it.  You may not advertise these sites though.<br>
2] If you feel the need to Role Play in-game, please keep it in a non-public chat like Personally Messaging or Here Chat.  It is allowed in Buddy Chat only if all buddies are participating or don't mind you RPing.  As soon as any buddies are annoyed, you must stop.<br>
3] You may not advertise Role Playing.  If you feel the need to participate, go ahead, but do not use a public chat to find more people.<br>
4] If you feel that the Role Playing is becoming inappropriate, immediately discontinue with it.<br>
5] File an Abuse Report if the conversation is directly inappropriate, breaking any Horse Isle rules, against ANY players still involved or being catalytic to the situation.</font><br><br>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Real Life Advice</b><br>
1] Please do not ask for real life advice on the game or in the forums.  You have no way of knowing who is answering the question and what their experience level is. <br>
2] Taking experience from people on the game could end up causing more problems.  Please see a professional in your area instead.<p> 


<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Releasing Parties</b><br>
1] Players have begun holding Releasing Parties.  What occurs during these is players congregate in one location and release horses.  Most of the time, the agreement is those that release will get the horse back.<br>
2] We highly advise that you do NOT partake in these "parties".  Horses are most frequently lost when a player captures the horse and won't return it.  We will not return horses that are lost in this manner.<br>
3] If you absolutely must hold these "parties", you are not allowed to advertise it and there may not be any entry fee.  You may talk with your buddies about it, or in Here Chat, but no one else should even know about it.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Uncaught wild horses</b><br>
1] Please do <b>NOT</b> attempt to "sell" the location of a wild horse, if you do not have the space, either point out it's location or move on.<br>
2] If you do this and another player comes up and catches the horse, they do not owe you anything as it was not your horse.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Released Horses</b><br>
1] Please do <b>not</b> attempt to threaten by telling others you are releasing the horse, and will point out the location when money is paid.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Gift Subscriptions</b><br>
1] You are allowed to sell subscriptions for in-game, Horse Isle money, however, Horse Isle does not endorse or recommend this since you must trade on a promise.<br>
2] When selling a subscription, you must buy the subscription via PayPal <b>before</b> receiving the money from the player you are buying the subscription for.  It is far more likely a player will pay you in-game money for a received subscription than it is for a player to pay real money to subscribe someone after they have received the in-game money.<br>
3] If the player you bought a subscription for does not pay you immediately after it shows up on their account (you should be able to tell if they log out and back in with a star) then contact support and we will take the money from the person and give it to you.  If we have to do this, more than what was promised will most likely be taken as a sort of payment for our time in the matter.<br>
4] A player not paying after they received a subscription is one of the <b>only</b> instances where we will go into the other player's account and take what was promised.<br>
5] If the subscription was paid for via PayPal eCheck, then the player receiving the subscription should wait until their account is credited, then pay the person that bought the subscription.<br>
6] DO NOT attempt to claim you are selling a subscription or pawneer order if you are not subscribed yourself.  This could land with you an immediate mute since, from our experience, someone that does not subscribe themselves will not subscribe someone else.<br>
7] For those paying the in-game money for the subscription.  If the player that is buying it insists you pay first, especially because they don't want to be scammed, do not give in.  The more they insist, the more likely it is that they will not follow through once you give the money.<br>
8] Make sure all money/transaction agreements are made On Game thus saved in the games chat logs.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Selling Accounts</b><br>
1] Do not attempt to sell any accounts, whether it be Horse Isle or some other game.<br>
2] If you are caught trying to sell an account, you will be given violations and possibly banned.<br>
3] Do not attempt to buy another player's account.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First of all, it will leave you with more than one account which is also against the rules.  The other problem is the account was set up under that person's email, so they can simply change the password so you no longer have access to it, then sell it to someone else.<br>
4] If you see someone claiming to sell an account, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Scams</b><br>
1] Scamming of any kind is <b>strictly</b> against the rules.<br>
2] The definition of a scam: "a confidence game or other fraudulent scheme, esp. for making a quick profit; swindle." ( Dictionary.com)<br>
3] Please be aware of other players attempting to scam. Do NOT willingly give out your money, horses or items as that will fall under an unfair trade. <br>
4] The only services that we suggest should pay for are those provided by Horse Isle itself, and not other players. <br>
5] If you notice a player attempting to scam please file an Abuse Report immediately and inform a moderator. <br>
6] Do not trade for a present because it could contain anything.<br>
7] Do not trade something you are not willing to lose.<br>
8] Once a horse or item leaves your account, it no longer belongs to you, although you can file an Abuse Report if an unfair trade has been performed. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Sharing an Account</b><br>
1] Do not share your account with another player.  This means allowing someone else on your account.<br>
2] You are 100% responsible for your account.  Should someone else log into your account, they could cause violations or steal from you.  So, keep your password well hidden and not easy to guess.<br>
3] If a friend or sibling wants to play the game, help them set up their own account.  They need to follow the instructions and use their own email address (or a parent's) and their own password.  Remember, you should not know their password.  Do this instead of letting them use yours.<br>
4] If you are not the account owner, but someone has given you their password, this does not give you the right or the okay to log onto their account, give them violations or remove anything from the account.  Any players we find doing this will have their own account banned.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Spam</b><br>
1] The definition of Spam is: "to post irrelevant messages one or more times in deliberate or accidental violation of rules."<br>
2] Please do <b>NOT</b> spam at any time (posting useless, or similar posts over and over again); <br>
e.g.:<i> "hiiiiiiiiiiiiiii hi hi hi hi hi hi"
"thi salkjfrhighokijfghbddddddddddddddoidtgf;iohj"</i></font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Slander</b><br>
1] The definition of Slander is: "a malicious, false, and defamatory statement or report: <i>a slander against his good name.</i>"<br>
2] Please do not slander another player, if you have a problem either mute the player or take it to the Personal Message feature.<br>
3] If you see a player slandering another player, or are being slandered in a public chat please file an Abuse Report immediately and Personally Mute the player. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Stealing</b><br>
1] Please do NOT attempt to steal from others, this is strictly against the rules.<br>
2] Logging onto another player's account and moving things off the account is considered stealing even if the other player gave you their password.  If we find you doing this, you will be banned and lose your account. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Slaughter</b><br>
1] Slaughter topics are <b>inappropriate</b> and should not be discussed at any time, we all love animals and do not appreciate these sorts of topics. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Starting Over/Quitting</b><br>
1] You may quit playing at anytime.  Your account will auto-delete after 183 days (6 months) of inactivity, or 183 days of inactivity after your subscription expires. <br>
2] When you quit, do <b>not</b> give away any horses, money or items.  Should you decide to play again with a new account you could get these things back and that would be cheating.<br>
3] If you feel the need to start over, your account may be deleted after giving sufficient proof that you are the account owner.<br>
4] To have your account deleted so that you can start over, contact support@horseisle.com from the email address you used to create your account.  Again, do <b>not</b> trade anything off your account.  Do <b>not</b> create a new account until we tell you that you may.</font></p><p><font face="verdana" size="2">

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Story Telling</b><br>
1] We do not encourage story telling in a Global or Public chat as it can sometimes be annoying to other players.<br>
2] If you feel the need to engage in Story Telling, please keep the discussion in the Personal Messaging system, or in Buddy Chat.<br>
3] If the Story violates any rules in any way, please file an Abuse report immediately.<br>
4] This note stands for Forums as well, should your Forum post violate rules, the post will be removed immediately. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Suggestions</b><br>
1] Suggestions are well appreciated, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of work to get most suggestions in effect.<br>
2] Admins do review all suggestions - they should be reasonable as it is not possible for some ideas to be carried out.<br>
3] Admins will try and add new breeds, suggestions and updates once to twice monthly, do not be offended if your suggested breeds or ideas are not added immediately - the process takes a long time to complete.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Services Provided by Players</b><br>
1] We do not endorse Horse Isle services attempted to be sold by other players, but do not prohibit the action.<br>
2] Please be careful when considering trading money or items for services rendered, the service might not be performed while the player advertising the service receives and keeps the money or item.<br>
3] Services offered can include but are not limited to: Training, Boarding, Collecting, Gift Subscriptions, etc.<br>
4] There have been cases of players attempting to sell non existent services or items (e.g.: "<i>Horse Maps</i>"); This action is considered scamming, if you are unsure about these services you may contact a Moderator or Admin to verify or report the action. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Training</b><br>
1] We do not advise that you willingly give your horse to another player for it to be trained in exchange for money.&nbsp; We cannot return the horse should it be stolen.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Terms Of Service</b><br>
1] Please ensure that you have read and that you understand fully our Terms of Service. By joining you agree to accept them, and you agree to follow all rules. <br>
2] If you are under the age of 18 and do not understand the Terms of Service, please ask a parent or guardian to help you through them.<br>
3] It is <b>extremely</b> important that you understand the Terms of Service. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Threats</b><br>1] Please do <b>NOT</b> engage in threatening another player in any way.&nbsp; This is strictly against the rules. <br>
2] If someone is threatening you, please Personally Mute the player immediately and file an Abuse Report. </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Trading Between Servers</b><br>
1] Trading between servers is not allowed as it is trading on a promise.  For example, you give a horse to a player while on one server and they promise to pay you on a different server.<br>
2] If a player refuses to pay for something they want from you on that server, then do not complete the trade.  Every trade must be fair in and of itself.<br>
3] If for some reason you do complete a trade like this, file a report on that player, though realize you will not get back what was stolen from you.<br>
4] You <b>may</b> buy Subscriptions and Pawneer Orders for players on <b>any</b> server.  The Subscription/Pawneer Order policy must be followed. (see: Selling Gift Subscriptions)  The two players must agree on the purchase while on the server that the receiving player will pay the paying player on.  The receiving player may get the Subscription/Pawneer Order for a different server though.<br>
  For example, PlayerA and PlayerB are on Roan.  PlayerB has agreed to purchase PlayerA a Subscription for the White server.  If the two agree on a price, then PlayerB purchases the sub on White using the Gift Subscription option.  Once PlayerA sees the sub on that server, they then pay PlayerB on Roan.  If PlayerA refuses to pay, or claims that it wasn't credited, then PlayerB needs to email support@horseisle.com to find out if it was credited and to get the payment if it was.  Remember that lying about it not being credited to attempt to get out of paying will most likely get you banned.</font><br><br>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Trading Between Games (between HI1 and HI2)</b><br>
1] Trading between HI1 and HI2 is not allowed as it is trading on a promise.  For example, you give a horse to a player while on HI1 and they promise to pay you on on HI2.<br>
2] If for some reason you do complete a trade like this, file a report on that player, though realize you will not get back what was stolen from you.</font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Tack Shop Giveaways</b><br>
1] Tack Shop Giveaways are Horse Isle generated special events where players are notified and are told to go to a designated Tack Shop on any given Island to stand the chance of winning a horse.<br>
2] Please do not be offended if you do not win or if another player wins more than you do.&nbsp; The selection is completely random, and the decision is final.<br>
3] Avoid sending Personal Messages asking the winning player if the horse is For Sale - the player will most likely Advertise if they plan to sell the horse.</font></p><p><font face="verdana" size="2">

<b>Trading on a Promise</b><br>
1] Trading on a promise is when one player gives something to another under the promise that the other will do their half of the trade, or return the traded item, at a later time.<br>
2] Horse Isle strongly advises to never do a trade on a promise.  Always be sure a trade is fair in and of itself.<br>
3] Trading on a promise includes, but is not limited to: trading between HI1 and HI2, trading between servers, having another player board or train your horse, lending items/money/horses, trading an item/horse/money with the player promising to pay you back later.<br>
4] If you do complete a trade on a promise and the other player does not fulfil their end of the deal, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br>
5] Horse Isle does not return items/horses/money that have been stolen.  So be very sure you are happy with a trade before you accept it.<p>

1] Once a horse or item leaves your account, it no longer belongs to you, although you can file an Abuse Report if an unfair trade has been performed.<br>
2] The trading system is set up so you both must ACCEPT what is offered.&nbsp; Be sure to include everything in one trade so you are not trading on a promise.&nbsp; If someone didn't offer something agreed upon, then don't ACCEPT the trade.<br>
3] If you were tricked into accepting something, then please file an Abuse Report against the player.<br> </font></p><p>

<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Wild Horses</b><br>
