 &nbsp; Horse Isle was envisioned and designed by Joe and Miranda Durbin.  Miranda grew up loving horses.  Joe grew up 
loving to work with computers and wanted to start his own company.  They noticed that there weren't many games out 
there for horse lovers that were in depth, challenging, and more involved than simple web pages.  So together they 
created Horse Isle.  Artists from around the world joined the project and contributed artwork, writing, and music.    
Miranda and Joe's family also pitched in.  Mothers, sisters, and cousins started helping with beta testing, island 
design, character and quest creation.  Now that the game has gone live many people help with continued development and moderating the game to be sure that Horse Isle continues to be a safe and fun place for everyone.
