  <u><b><font size=5>Moderator Guide Book</font></b></u><br>
</div>
<br>
<font size=3>You are probably looking at how long this is and thinking, what am I getting myself into?!?&nbsp; I have made this for a couple reasons.&nbsp; One is to clean out the Mod Forum (essentially everything here is from posts in the Mod Forum) and the other is to have everything, hopefully, a little more accessible and easy to find for all of you.&nbsp; My hope is that this will serve as a good reference guide as well as being sure we are all on the same page.&nbsp; This should make modding easier for everyone.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned, these are directly out of the Mod Forum.&nbsp; Some are posts from me to clarify something, while others were questions posed by mods and the answers that were given.&nbsp; I felt it would help to keep some of the questions in there instead of simply summarizing everything in order to make some things more clear, as well as including moderating tips from others.&nbsp; I have also tried to have it in some semblance of order.&nbsp; Hopefully it will all make sense.<br>
<br>
Included in here are all the Moderator Commands.&nbsp; The Moderator Commands link will still be available at the bottom of the Server List page to see the other tips we gave, though many of them are also in this 'book', simply worded differently.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions about anything in this 'book', please feel free to email me at miranda@horseisle.com.&nbsp; Also remember that this email is for mods only.&nbsp; Never give this out to players.&nbsp; They need to contact support@horseisle.com<br>
Thanks!<br>

  <br>
</div>
<font size=2>The following commands are available to moderators in the game.&nbsp; These need to be used for REAL rule breaking!&nbsp; Never for fun or for personal reasons.&nbsp; Doing so will cause us to have to immediately remove your Moderator Privileges.<br>
Use these ONLY when it is necessary.&nbsp; No one appreciates getting "yelled at", so make sure what happens deserves it.&nbsp; Make sure you are FAIR also.&nbsp; If someone else started something and you just penalize the second person, that is not fair.&nbsp; Try to penalize both parties equally when possible.<br>
<br>
All of the commands use BECAUSE so that the admins reviewing the abuse reports know why the player was muted, sent to Rules, etc.&nbsp; The player does NOT see this.&nbsp; Also, you can use BC instead of BECAUSE for faster typing if you like.&nbsp; Either will work.<br>
</font> <hr> <font size=2><b>%<a id=v.xb name=PRISON></a>PRISON</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>BECAUSE</b> <i>Expain valid reason here</i><br>
Using this command sends the player to Prison Isle where they need to spend a few minutes breaking rocks to get off. THIS is not used for serious rulebreaking. Just minor stuff, such as: Begging, globaling private riddle answers/bridge passwords. </font><hr> <font size=2><b>%<a id=r_.n name=MUTE></a>MUTE</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>15</b> <b>BECAUSE</b> <i>Explain valid reason here</i><br>
<b>%UNMUTE</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>BECAUSE</b> <i>Explain valid reason here</i><br>
This disables (or enables) a player from chatting to anyone OR getting any chats for 15 minutes. (Admins excepted)<br>
Valid reasons for doing this include: Potty talk, severe chat spamming (continuing after being asked to stop), severe begging, being mean to people/rude, etc.<br>
Appropriate Lengths of Time to Mute:<br>
5 Minutes - More of a warning for a mild offense.<br>
15 Minutes - Break up a small dispute.<br>
30 minutes - Minor chat filter avoidance.<br>
1440 Minutes (Full Day) - SERIOUS racial slurs/extreme swearing filter avoidance.<br>
2880 minutes (Two Days) - Someone that should probably be banned from the game. Send an abuse report that an admin will review and take appropriate action.<br>
<br>
If a player does not seem to learn from being muted and continues the behavior after the mute is up, increase the mute time slightly. If they were muted for 15 minutes, then mute for 30. If they continue after that, mute for 60, etc.&nbsp; Do remember that an hour is a long time for a kid, so if they still aren't getting it after a few mutes, don't just jump to 1440, do 2 or 4 hours first.<br>
</font> <hr> <font size=2><b>%<a id=v_eh name=RULES></a>RULES</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>BECAUSE </b></font><font size=2><i>Explain valid reason here</i></font><font size=2><br>
This will send the offending player to a part of Prison Isle called Rule Isle. This is only to be used for players that don't seem to understand the rules, as in, they are frequently getting muted for spamming/begging/rudeness. This is also good for players that seem to laugh at getting muted. A player will be automatically muted for 20 minutes when sent here.<br>
Do Not use this on players that continue to post riddles/passwords in global. This is for more serious offenses. For that, if they are chronic sharers of such things, mute them for 5 or 10 and remind them why they shouldn't share those in global.<br>
<b>Important:DO NOT overuse this isle!</b> It will lose its effectiveness if used too frequently on the same player(s). There are 4 sets of questions asked. After the 4th time there the questions stay the same. If sent too often, the player will be able to memorize the answers and will get nothing out of being sent there. </font> <hr> <font size=2><b>%<a id=k15n name=BAN></a>BAN</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>BECAUSE</b> <i>Explain valid reason here</i><br>
This requires TWO moderators to actually happen. Both have to ban the same player one after the other.<br>
Appropriate reasons for doing this:<br>
Very bad PlayerName - Offensive<br>
Terrible behavior that cannot be controlled by a MUTE (??)<br>
Mainly for use when a new player logs in with an awful name that is certainly not wanted.&nbsp; Two mods can still ban a player even if the player has logged off,&nbsp; as long as the player has an account on that server. </font><br>
<font size=2> IT BLOCKS: email / name / and IP from being able to sign up again. It also kicks the player off.<br>
</font> <hr> <font size=2><b><a id=l7jh name=Misc_comm></a>%VIEW</b> <i>PlayerName</i> <b>STATS</b><br>

<br>
Please do not advertise to the players that you have these abilities. There is no reason for them to know about it.</font><br>
<hr> <font size=2><b>%SHORTCUTS</b><br>
This is used to view a list of Text Shortcuts for common responses to players. Please try to PM to players to keep from flooding the chat with these. These should really only be used in global when saying a general reminder because a number of people are breaking that rule, such as a number of people forgetting to use Ads Chat. If only one person forgets, please private message them.<br>
example: /joe *ADS* - Would yell at joe for forgetting to use Ads Chat :)<br>

This hides you from the player lists in the game.&nbsp; Your name will still show up on the web page and they will see you when you are walking around, but it should help to keep some players from knowing you are online if you want to take some time to play by yourself.&nbsp; Simply type it again to go back to normal mode.<br>

<b><a id=g1.o name=Players_Being_Sent_to_Prison></a>Players Being Sent to Prison</b><br>
There are 4 ways to get sent to Prison Isle. A mod, you pay Griffin, you get to King Phil's isle without permission or are mean to him, or one of your horse's health gets down to zero.&nbsp; That's it. It's impossible for them to just get tossed there.&nbsp; There are actually a number of players that talk to Griffin, get sent, and don't even realize that's what they did.&nbsp; They were probably clicking through the chat quick.&nbsp; So, if they say they were in Earton before going to Prison, that's always a possibility.<br>
<br>
<b><a id=go7l name=6_Horse_Glitch></a>6 Horse Glitch?</b><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod: </span>I was told today that there is a glitch that people are using to their advantage. They have 5 horses, put one up for auction at Appleton where no one ever auctions, then take a horse trade while auctioning, knowing that their horse will not sell. This way they end up with 6 horses.</i><br>
<br>
<span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> Yep. We aren't worrying about it. They can only get 1 extra horse.&nbsp; Don't encourage them getting 6, but if they have 6 it doesn't really matter.<br>
<br>
<b>When are <a id=ixpt name=New_Breeds_in_the_Game></a>New Breeds in the Game to be Captured?</b><br>
Every time a wild horse is caught, another wild horse of a random breed replaces it.&nbsp; Once the new breed is announced, it immediately is just as likely to be placed in the game as any other breed, keeping the number of wild horses consistent, while varying the count of any specific breed.<br>
<br>
Some have said about 24 hours because that's probably about how long it will be before one happens to get into the game.&nbsp; That doesn't mean one won't pop into the world earlier than that.&nbsp; It all depends on how fast the wild horses are being captured.&nbsp; The more people are catching horses, the better chance the new breed will come into the world.<br>
<br>
<b>Players<a id=x5nz name=Changing_Their_Username></a> Changing Their Username</b><br>
The policy, which is actually on the "Contact Us", is the player must be a current subscriber and they can only change it once.<br>
Please tell players that changing the names makes a mess of the system, so if they can live with their name, please do.&nbsp; On occasion we allow players to change their username back to what it was originally if they don't like what it has been changed to, but we try to avoid this.<br>
<br>
<b><a id=c-hc name=Multiple_Accounts></a>Multiple Accounts</b><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod: </span>Miranda, when you or Joe contact them do you guys tell them why they can only have the one account? And I am assuming it is because of 1. it is just fair to the other players and 2. limited space on the servers? Has the response to it been pretty good or do people get upset about it? I am just being curious so if it is none of my business please feel free to ignore!</i><br>
<br>
<span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer: </span>The main reason is a fairness issue. People can create another account for more playtime (which defeats the purpose of subscribing since they have basically unlimited playtime then). They also use mult accounts to hold more horses and can do the easy quests again then move the money to their 'main' account. These are the main reasons that we don't allow mult accounts.<br>
As you know, we limit playing to only one free account per server within 24 hours.&nbsp; This was done in an attempt to help thwart this multiple account problem.&nbsp; Though it has helped, there are still people with multiples out there, and still some that cheat by moving things from one account to another.&nbsp; This is very common when either the player wants to start over with a new account, or they are afraid they are going to be banned.&nbsp; They move all their stuff to a new account not realizing this is strictly against the rules.&nbsp; This is also one of the reasons we have the rule about no giving things away when you quit or want your account deleted.<br>
We really don't explain to player specifically why multiple accounts aren't allowed when they are banned for it and email in.&nbsp; We simply say it is against the rules and cheating.&nbsp; If they ask for specifics we do give it to them though.<br>
<br>
<b>Not Allowing <a id=pt2o name=Advertising_of_Websites></a>Advertising of Websites</b><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod: </span>I had one player going after me today for the 'don't talk about other sites' rule. I explained that it was rude and disrespectful of this site, but I wasn't sure what else to tell them when they kept pushing me to point out where it's an actual rule....I was trying to avoid the 'because I said so' scenario, but I was at a loss.</i><br>
<br>
<span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer: </span>We don't allow the advertising of other sites because we cannot control the content on those sites.&nbsp; Not only could content be inappropriate, but someone could say "I'm such-and-such on HorseLand", and if they have personal info on that site, then all of our rules about not allowing personal info go out the door.<br>
<br>
Under Rule #2 it says No Sharing Websites, so it is clearly stated in the rules.&nbsp; I realize that some people just want to share an article that has absolutely no personal info on it, but it's better and safer on our end to just make it a blanket statement.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b><a id=hzhb name=Buying_Gift_Subscriptions></a>Buying Gift Subscriptions or Pawneer Orders for Game Money</b><br>
Please read the Detailed Rules un "Selling Gift Subscriptions" and understand this policy very clearly.&nbsp; Many players are still cheated out of money by doing this the wrong way.&nbsp; Encourage players to remember to never give any form of payment, not even half, until after the sub or PO is on their account.&nbsp; The more the other player insists, the less likely they are to actually purchase it for them.<br>
<b><br>
Tip on <a id=ab2l name=Keeping_Messages_out_of_Global></a>Keeping Messages out of Global</b><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod: </span>Is there a way to stop messages from going into global when a player logs off? Many times we warn a player and they log off before we hit send and our messages go into global. I know it doesn't just happen to me.</i><br>
<br>
<span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> If you type the /playername, it won't go in global, a message comes up that just says that it can't find the player. That is a big advantage to using that command and not using the drop down box if you are not having a long conversation with the player.&nbsp; Also realize that you do not need to type the player's entire username.&nbsp; Just enough to distinguish it from everyone else online.&nbsp; So, say there were 2 players, one named Firey and another named FireFly and you needed to speak to FireFly.&nbsp; You can just type /firef and it will go to that player.<br>
<br>
Another good tip is to set your chat to CHAT MOD and then use the /a to chat in global.&nbsp; Then if you happen to slip up, it is done so in in Mod chat, which is not only less embarassing, but safer if the post involves sensitive info.<br>
<b><br>
<a id=k28m name=Mod_Muting_Timer></a>Mod Muting Timer</b><br>
I've noticed some mods think the mute timer actually adds up.&nbsp; If you muted someone for 30 minutes, then for another 30 it would mean they are actually muted for 60 minutes. That is NOT the case.<br>
The timer does not compound, it actually replaces. So, if you want to extend a player's mute that is already muted then you need to put in the total amount of time you want them muted. It will overwrite whatever is already there.<br>
Also, the mute does count down on its own and the player will be unmuted automatically once the timer reaches 0.<br>
</font><font size=2><br>
<b>Server <a id=imz6 name=Time_Limit_for_Mods></a>Time Limit for Mods</b><br>
If you are not subscribed on a server and it tells you that you have 0 minutes of time remaining, it doesn't matter.&nbsp; The timer will still go down for you, but you will not get kicked off.&nbsp; So, technically, mods have unlimited playtime whether they are subscribed or not.&nbsp; This is not something that should be known to other players.&nbsp; It is basically a safeguard so you guys can log onto a server and be there if you need or want to be, even without playtime available.<br>

<font size=2><b><a id=skro name=What_Happens_in_Mod_Chat></a>What Happens in Mod Chat/Forum Stays There</b><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> Many of us have friends who are not mods. They don't need to know everything that goes on in mod chat.</i><br>
<br>
It is incredibly important that all of the mods respect what is said in this forum and what is said in Mod Chat and to respect your fellow Moderators and leave it there, not telling other players about it.&nbsp; Many mods rant/vent in Mod Chat, most of which is completely harmless unless possibly taken out of context.<br>
<br>
This is a trust issue. The mods need to trust each other.&nbsp; If there is something bothering you that another mod says, please take it to me, not other players.<br>
<br>
I do want you guys to stand by each other if one mod does PM a player about something.&nbsp; You may disagree with the mod and it's great to discuss why you did something, etc, but if the player comes to a different one of you, please back up what the other mod did.&nbsp; Not doing so undermines the others.<br>
<b><br>
<br>
<a id=b-uj name=Copy/Pasting_Chat></a>Copy/Pasting Chat</b><br>
Please do not copy/paste what players say to you into mod chat.&nbsp; I understand sometimes what they say is really funny.&nbsp; That's fine.&nbsp; I'm talking about the bad stuff.&nbsp; Some of you may be looking for guidance and help, but copy/pasting makes the abuse reports a mess.&nbsp; Also, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the mods need to see that junk also.&nbsp; You guys all see enough of that.<br>
<br>
If you really need help deciding what to do with a player, please just generalize what's happening.&nbsp; We are seeing this copy/pasting far too much and most of the time it does not appear to be for help.&nbsp; Sometimes it even accidentally goes to the player that it is about, which looks really bad for you and can confuse the player, making the situation worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a id=lp7e name=Making_Assumptions></a>Making Assumptions</b><br>
It is important to me that all of you do not make assumptions about other players, especially based on what other mods have told you.&nbsp; This affects how you respond to that player both when they say something in global or when they come to you.&nbsp; I have seen this more than once.<br>
<br>
In one instance, a player came to a mod about a situation where she didn't want to appear as a 'mini-mod'.&nbsp; Instead of simply being told 'thanks' and it being left at that, she was basically talked down to.&nbsp; I believe this was because she was known to be a player mods had some trouble with.<br>
<br>
Please try and treat every player the same.&nbsp; Even if it is a player you tend to have problems with.&nbsp; How are they supposed to get better or change if the mods assume they won't?<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font size=2><b><a id=ys9: name=PMing_Players></a>PMing Players<br>
</b>I am seeing more and more of the mods stating in global about the ads, or other rule breaks, instead of pming the specific player that is causing the issue. Unless there are a number of people doing the same type of thing, please please please remember to specifically pm the player.<br>
<br>
Constantly saying in global "that's your last warning" or "the next person to say that gets muted" tends to get people upset or make them 'test' you. By keeping it in pm, many of the players won't act out, and if they do, it will just be to you and not involve all of global.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a id=t4mz name=Bombarding_Players></a>Bombarding Players</b><br>
If there is more than one mod on a server, please remember to tell each other when you are pming a player about a problem. Say "I got playername" so that the other mods know that player has been talked to already. When players get bombarded by pms by mods for spam, or whatever, they tend to get edgy as I'm sure you would also if you were told the same thing 3 or 4 times right in a row. Make sure you tell Mod chat that you're going to PM the player Before you do it. Not after.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font size=2><b><a id=vt8t name=_Threatening_Players></a>"Threatening" Players</b><br>
I have been getting complaints about mods threatening players with muting. Basically, "stop doing such and such or I'll mute you". This is not dissimilar to when players threaten each other with filing an abuse report which is something we discourage.<br>
<br>
Please never 'threaten' to mute. Nicely tell the person in pm to stop (please space out your ads a bit; please stop the conversation in global, it is just escalating a problematic situation, etc etc) then if they continue, mute for an appropriate amount of time and tell them why they were muted.&nbsp; Hopefully this will help with some of the rude players, as many of them tend to get rude once 'threatened'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font size=2> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If a player continues basically right after you warned them (within a few minutes) go ahead and mute after the first warning. Be sure that the warning was in pm, that way there is very little chance of them missing it. So if you do a general warning in global and someone or some people continue, then warn him/her/them in pm.&nbsp; If they continue an hour later or the next day, then warn once in pm again, if they continue, mute then explain why they were muted.<br>
<br>
Given this, it's important to not be nit-picky. With spamming, it should be annoying. When I'm in the game and watching a server, I never count how long it's been between posts. I go by, 'hmm.. I've seen this post before recently' or 'that post is still on the screen, but they only have it twice, so I'll ignore that' If they do it again, then I warn. When it's annoying is when you need to jump on it.<br>
<br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> I would like to point out that a lot of these players are young kids - and I have had some of them tell me that the mods take the fun out of the game. I would just like to say that maybe be a little easier with them - Say please a lot and just be overall friendly, I know it can be very hard at times when you have so many people breaking rules.<br>
I think we should all remember that behind the computer there is a person with feelings. (I also have to remind myself that on the other side of the screen there could be a 7 y.o being scolded for advertising to much and they don't know why)<br>
Players can be very difficult, but I think we could all try just a little more to be a little nicer at times. I have had my share of hard days of modding - but you can't really blame one kid for your whole day. (Sorry, if this doesn't apply to you - I have just noticed some mods can come down pretty hard on players for a minor reason IE: spam, caps, asking about riddles etc)<br>
</i><br>
As many of you have noticed, many players don't read everything in global, so even though you just said a minute ago, please don't post passwords in global, it doesn't mean that they read it. :)&nbsp; </font><font size=2>Using a shortcut or asking for rules to be followed in Global is too easy for them to ignore or claim they didn't know it was meant for them. If we PM, then they have the chance to discuss it privately with us, and save face in front of their friends.<br>
<br>
</font><font size=2>If you find that there are players that are constantly giving out passwords or riddle answers, then go ahead and mute then tell them why. If it's someone that's just trying to be helpful and maybe they didn't see your post because they were busy typing, just pm them and nicely explain why we don't want passwords/riddle answers in global (no need to mute, it's already done).&nbsp; This rule break is not a serious thing, so at most a 5-10 minute mute. Mostly just to get their attention.<br>
<br>
When "yelling" at players to stop a conversation, I would recommend staying away from posting words in all caps as some players jump down the mods' throats about "all caps" even though having one or two words in caps is fine. :) Just a thought.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font><font size=2><b><a id=xqup name=Muting_Players></a>Muting Players</b><br>
Please remember to tell a player why they were muted after you muted them. I realize sometimes it may seem like you have too much going on, but just a quick, "You have been muted for not using ads chat. Please remember to post all buying and selling in Ads." or something similar is all that's needed. For the most part you shouldn't need to discuss it with them further and it prevents them from coming back at you saying "Why was I muted?" Even if you warned them 5 times and you think they should -know- why they're muted. For the most part, making a quick comment right after should save you more hassle. Then you are contacting them quickly instead of them trying to find the mod that muted them.<br>
<br>
When a player is muted, all it says to the player is "Your chat has been disabled by a Moderator for x minutes."<br>
<br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> When a mod mutes, send to rules or prison and that player logs out then back in- do they appear back in prison, rules and/or still muted?<br>
<span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> Also, When those reports are sent in is it just the chat that's in the box before that abuse report that's sent in? Or does it keep track of it after it's sent as well?</i><br>
</font><font size=2><br>
When a player gets sent to Rule or Prison Isle, they are there until they get off themselves. Doesn't matter if they log out and back in. Muting is real time. So if you mute for 10 and they log off then they come back in 10 minutes, they won't be muted anymore.<br>
<br>
Abuse reports send in a set number of lines of chat before you muted them or before the report was sent in. So, I do not see anything after the muting. Therefore, if a player harasses you a bunch after you mute them, then be sure to send in a separate abuse report.&nbsp; You can file a report on a player that is not currently logged in.&nbsp; So, if someone logs off before you can mute, file a report instead so they will still get the violation point(s).<br>
<br>
Never mute or ban another player based on a hearsay.&nbsp; The person could very easily be lying.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><a id=zzj2 name=Rude_Players></a>Rude Players</b><br>
I see players and mods often telling another player that they are being rude, or something they are doing is rude. Really, how often does telling someone they're being rude every help the situation? Rarely ever. For the most part they get offended or defensive. Best to just politely respond to the rude player and explain the rule they're breaking or just ignore them. By saying 'You really shouldn't do that. Do you realize that is very rude?' What do you expect them to say? Yes?<br>
<br>
</font><font size=2>I'm noticing many mods replying to 'rude/disrespectful' players. The ones that say 'whatever', for example, after you ask them to follow some rule.<br>
Please do NOT respond to these players.&nbsp; I realize many of you see it as disrespect and they should know that being rude won't get them anywhere.&nbsp; The problem here is that responding to them fuels them and gives the response they were most likely fishing for, it doesn't teach them anything.&nbsp; In some cases, mods have been a bit rude back which definitely doesn't help.<br>
<br>
There is little that can be done about this online. It is the parents' job to teach the kid to be polite.&nbsp; </font><font size=2>It is the mods' job to make sure Horse Isle is a safe place.&nbsp; </font><font size=2>Mute if it is serious, but if it's just a dumb remark, please ignore it and move on.</font><font size=2>&nbsp;<br>
</font><font size=2><br>
<i><span style=COLOR:#990000>Another Admin:</span> I think the rude factor is one of the things that bothers Miranda the most. If a player is rude to you, your best bet is to not give them any ammo but to ignore it. I know in the heat of the moment it's difficult. Remind yourself they are just little kids and their misbehavior is being amplified by the anonymity of the internet. You're not losing face, you're just being the more grown-up one. Or change the subject to something really popular and the problem player will soon be ignored by everyone.<br>

She also told me to remember to never use Threats. You can PM them "Please don't do this" but don't give them an "Or else..." Give them a request to stop (or two) and then just mute them the next time and explain afterwards why they were muted in a PM. Threats don't help and actually get the misbehaving players more riled up. Sometimes Mods lose track and don't remember to back up their threat</i> </font><font size=2><i>so it actually makes the situation worse not better.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Instead of telling the player not to be rude, let them know that it is against Horse Isle rules to talk badly about someone.&nbsp; The way you word is how they respond.&nbsp; Telling someone that they are rude, will make them more defensive and make them not want to listen.&nbsp; Explain what they are doing wrong, and why, and you will have a better response from them.</i><br>
<br>
Example: You tell a player to keep something out of global.&nbsp; They PM you and say "shut up" or "whatever".&nbsp; Completely ignore the comment.&nbsp; If they do or say whatever it was in global again, mute for 5 or 10 (depending on what was said it could even be longer).&nbsp; Then PM the player and say "you were muted for x minutes for ____".&nbsp; Leave it at that.&nbsp; If they say, "How is that against the rules?!"&nbsp; Politely explain the rule to them, or say "it was causing problems in global so I asked you to stop, since you didn't, you were muted."&nbsp; If they start bashing you, ignore it.&nbsp; Depending on what is said, file a second abuse report.&nbsp; If they resort to swearing or crude language/name calling, go ahead and extend the mute.<br>
<br>
In general though, I really don't like the mods muting players when it has to do with PMs directly to you. It feels too personal then. If the player was doing that exact same thing to another player, they wouldn't get completely muted, since the player doesn't have that power. Instead file a report as any other player would do. Again, if it is serious enough, go ahead and extend their mute, then explain to them that you did so, however, I would prefer that extending the mute was more of a last resort rather than a common one.&nbsp; Remember that your personal mute only mutes PM from players.&nbsp; You will still see their chat in other channels.<br>

<b><a id=orko name=Anger_Statements_About_Rules></a>Anger Statements About Rules</b><br>
Remember if you can explain to a person that says a rule is dumb why it is a rule, it often helps the situation. Most often people get upset, or say a rule is dumb, when they don't understand why it is a rule.&nbsp; Instead of just stating that it is a rule, so you should follow it, please try to explain why it is as such.<br>
If you don't understand any of our rules, or why we have them, please ask.<br>

<br>
<b><a id=sy60 name=_I_am_a_Mod_></a>"I am a Mod"</b><br>
I have seen some mods use the general phrase, "I am a mod so follow the rules" or something similar. Players should be told why they should follow the rules if they don't already know/if they are questioning why.&nbsp; Saying "Because I'm a mod" is basically the same as a parent saying "because" when a kid asks why they can't do something (something I always hated as a kid).<br>
If a player is asking why they should listen to you, explain that you are there to help the game run smoothly and be sure players follow the rules.&nbsp; They can read the Expected Behavior if they want to know more.<br>
<br>
Be sure players understand why they were muted, or why they should follow a certain rule (if they are questioning it) or why they should even listen to you. The "Because I'm a mod" doesn't work and tends to just anger players.<br>

<a id=kn2w name=Nitpicking></a>Nitpicking</b><br>
Some of the mods are getting too bent out of shape over some pretty minor stuff. This is a game. Let the kids play. If they want to have a little camp. Fine. If they want to act like their horses are dating. Fine. If they want to marry their horses. Fine. The no dating policy is for players. We don't want players to come on specifically looking for a boyfriend/girlfriend as that would encourage other behavior. Innocent play acting isn't that big of a deal.<br>
<br>
The more mods harp on players for very minor things, like missing ads chat once in a while, or having 'camp', the harder it makes the admins' jobs and the harder it makes your job as a mod. When you start to get on a player about something that doesn't really matter that much, they email us complaining and they harass you.<br>
<br>
Please remember that for the most part, these are just kids that like to play and make stuff up. There are much more important things to worry about than kids RPing with their horses or forgetting ads chat once or twice.<br>
<br>
As mods, the less you harp on the kids for 'little' things, the easier time you will have with them and the more fun you'll get to have playing.<br>

<i><span style=COLOR:#990000>Joe:</span> Hi Mods! I know, I don't communicate much.. But I just want stress that lately, it seems we are having more mod vs players issues, And the single best way to avoid this is to not "Over-mod" or "Nit Pick". This is critical. Think about how you like the Police in your city. They are great when they are there for emergencies, and when needed. But, when they start telling you how to live every part of your life no one is happy... . Most of the tension can be relieved by simply doing "less" not by doing anything "more". .<br>
<br>
Also, if something is really annoying in the game, or imbalanced, it is far better for me to implement a server block or adjustment for it, rather than mods jumping on it. So, be sure to communicate ideas for such things to me.<br>

This has two effects:<br>
1. the players tend to go to each other for answers and therefore they develop relationships, and game play becomes more enjoyable for everyone.<br>
2. This also reduces the dependency on us as moderators and allows us to play our game, as well as saving our fingers (from Repetitive Phrase Injury **laughing out loud!**)<br>

    Players should NEVER share their password with others. Not even if they know the person in real life.

If anything does happen, I still have to deal with it. Also, if others find out that a player let someone else on their account, then not only do we have to handle it (often involving banning) but it also allows the kids to think that account sharing is done all the time and is not against the rules.<br>
    <br>
    So, if anyone approaches you asking if it is okay to share their password with someone else because they are going on a trip, or they want help with quests, tell them it is against the rules and it could possibly get them banned. </font><br>

    If something is suggestive, or very obviously trying to attract attention in a dating sense, then go ahead and ask them to change it.&nbsp; If they won't, then delete it.<br>
    Remember begging and asking for donations in descriptions is fine. It is not being forced on anyone and if they want to be known as a beggar, than that's their deal. They just can't bug people in chat about it.&nbsp;<BR>
    Religion should not be mentioned.  There simply isn't a reason for others to know what religion a player is.  Quotes from the bible in a profile are only okay if there is no book and verse listed and if it isn't "relgious sounding".  That can be up to interpretation, but use your best judgment.<br>
    <br>
    Always ask the player to change their description first.&nbsp; If they won't, then delete it.&nbsp; When you delete a profile, the description shows up in an abuse report and will be given violation points if warranted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Realize no chat comes in with these reports, so if the player was very rude or combative about it, then it might be a good idea to file an abuse report also.&nbsp; If you ever have doubts about a profile/description, go ahead and ask each other or email me.<br>

Regardless of that, I just don't see that it is our responsibility to monitor the values, ethics and morals of the players. Do I agree with what they are doing? Absolutely not - but I am a moderator for the SITE, not a babysitter for these kids. The way they play in the sandbox is none of my concern unless, and until, it violates the rules.

    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod Answer1:</span> First offense, I put a reminder in global and PM the offending player the same reminder, so that I am sure they see it. The reminder in global is so the mini-mods don't take it upon themselves to tell the person to use ads chat. If I see the same player do it again, I PM them a second warning. On the third offense, they get a 5 minute mute, and I tell them to please not put ads in the global chat because it is bothersome to the other players.<br>
    <br>
    I do not mute ads, so I can see who is consistently using them. I occasionally hand out topaz necklaces to people who consistently use the ads chat and don't tend to "slip up."<br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod Answer 2:</span> If I notice a player post an ad in global, and I have seen them use ads chat all the time, I just ignore it. It is usually followed quickly by a "sorry wrong chat".<br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod Answer 3:</span> Just went and read the rules. Ads Chat is in the rules. Under rule #3 it says:<br>
    There is an Auto-Sell and auction system to sell horses. Please use that instead of spamming the global chat. There is even an 'Ads Only' channel specifically for selling things. This should be used for any ads instead of global chat.<br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod Answer 4:</span> I do the three warnings also - they get a pm that I have created first - then a *second warning* with the pm - then *last warning* then a 5 minute mute. Once I mute I send a pm explaining they were muted because and that they must use the ads chat. It usually doesn't go past this. However just a couple of times they have gotten unmuted and done it again. Then it's a warning one time and if it happens again an immediate 10 min mute followed by the same explanation. If they argue I just repost the explanation to them - I think they must wonder if it's automated *laughing out loud!*. I won't provide addt'l explanation though or justify it to them. That's where it usually ends I've noticed.<br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> Please please please be sure when you mute someone that they deserve it. There was a player that started out not using ads chat and was told to. From that point on she consistently used ads chat except for once when it went into global, and she was then muted. Let that stuff go. If you see them mostly using ads chat, then if they do slip up once or twice, who cares. Chances are it was an accident, and if it wasn't, they'll do it more frequently to the point that you should mute them.<br>
    <br>
    Just remember to announce to your fellow mods that you are warning a player. In one instance, a mod warned the player, but another one muted them. So, one assumed the player was getting a warning but the other just straight out muted.&nbsp; Remember to communicate so you know what's going on and so players don't get bombarded.<br>

    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> If people are constantly using ads chat for regular chat because they are running out of global minutes, then they should be spoken too.&nbsp; For the most part, don't worry about it though.&nbsp; I assume a lot more people mute Ads Chat than global, so less people are hearing what they're saying anyway.

So those asking these ones in global I have begun to mute also, but the other riddles and password areas do not say anything about not asking. How do we deal with those people.. should we mute them too? Can we have something added to all the quiz and riddle areas to warn people not to discuss them in global?</i><br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> We may be able to add something, but if you can catch when someone asks and quick, ask nicely to not ask the riddles in global because it spoils the surprise for others, hopefully people won't answer.&nbsp; In that case, if you explain it (not just say "no riddles in global") hopefully people will understand and not ask again, or not answer the riddle. I know that's asking a lot.. but... hopefully it helps some.<br>

I don't like the answers for that in global because there are a number of people that want to figure it out on their own and saying the answers in global does ruin it for them.&nbsp; If they really want help with questions, </font><font size=2>ask them to not directly ask the quiz questions in global.&nbsp; They can ask for the question number or the general idea of the question.&nbsp; <i>"What's the one about South Africa? PM me."</i></font><font size=2><br>
    <br>
    Try to keep it light hearted too. "<i>Guys, don't spoil the quiz for others please :( </i>" etc. Directly yelling at players, whether global or PM gets them upset and less likely to comply. If you see the same player asking questions directly/giving answers after you've asked them not to, then mute.</font><br>
    <font size=2><br>
    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> If with the real time quiz players are encouraged to web search, is there any problem with them discussing the answers afterwards. I see it as a learning process - particularly if the players wants to know why the answer was the answer...</i><br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> The problem is, the answers come up again. There are about 400 questions and they do circulate around pretty regularly. The more the answers are discussed in global, the more others find out the answer for next time it comes around, then they don't have to do the looking up.<br>
    I love that you guys like to discuss the questions and help them learn and understand, but if you have a group, maybe try and get the group in a general area and use chat near, or try to PM people.<br>

    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> <i>I had a player last night, actually two, doing their own quizzes and handing out prizes. One of them said that the players had to meet them at a certain place, while the other posted the question in global and told players to PM her with the answer. I figured both of these ways, since they had found ways to mostly keep it out of global, was fine.<br>
    I don't know how the player you're referring to was doing their quizzes though... </i>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span>&nbsp; If there aren't many players on and most appear to be participating (no one's objecting) then I wouldn't worry about it.&nbsp; It is a good idea to ask them to keep it to Ads Chat, so that it does limit them to posting the question once a minute at the most.&nbsp; But do let them have their fun. If it's the prime time when there are 100 players on, then best to ask them to go to a specific area and use Near or Island Chat (if it's a small, not frequently traveled isle).<br>

    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod1:</span> I have had this happen a lot lately- a player releases a horse for whatever reason- someone else catches it and keeps it. Now- if I understand right- once the horse is released it's fair game to anyone. If someone else catches the horse- they do not have to give it back to whoever released it and we as mods don't get involved in the dispute. If they feel they were wronged they file an abuse report. Am I correct or have I been thinking all wrong? any advice would be much Appreciated. </i><br>
    <br>
    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod2:</span> I believe that logic is correct. Also, if a players says "I'm standing on a wild horse" in global, then wants whoever catches it to pay them money, no money is owed, correct?</i><br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> Many players claim to release a horse accidentally. You have to push an "are you sure" button before a horse is released, so if they are really that click-happy to not notice they were releasing a horse, than they need to pay more attention.&nbsp; If they are releasing horses in order to trade with each other, tell them that even if they have full horses and want to trade with another player, so long as both players add a horse to the trade, it can go through. They don't need to release a horse to get down below max horses.<br>
    <br>
    No selling the location of wild or released horses.&nbsp; If they want to release fine, or announce a wild horse fine, but they may not charge for it.<br>
    </font><font size=2><br>
    A horse that is released disappears after 1 hour but a wild horse will stay wild and, if not caught, will disappear on its own after 24 hours. All releasing does is prevent new horses from being randomly put into the game if the number wild is above 30, so if players want to release horses instead of sell to a player or the Pawneer, don't worry about it.&nbsp; The act of releasing a horse does not remove a wild one from the game.<br>

    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> A player found a profile that disturbed her, and asked me to look into it. It's below:<br>

You WILL be getting a GREAT companion or two if you decide to come to the party. You WILL get a foal if you show up but ONLY if you drop your companion.<br>
    <br>
    Does this look like a scam to you? What, if anything, should be done?</i><br>
    <br style=COLOR:#990000>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> This has been a popular thing lately and all it seems to do is get people upset. Of the few I have checked, the person that claimed they were going to drop a foal never did. So, these "companion parties" are not allowed to be advertised and are highly discouraged.&nbsp; They are not strictly against the rules, because there is no way to actually enforce that.&nbsp; The way we have it set up, you, the mod, shouldn't even know that it is happening.<br>
    <br>
    If they do feel the need to have these "companion parties" and you do know about it, just be sure to warn people in general that it's highly unlikely anyone would actually drop a foal at these things and if they participate it's their fault if they lose a companion.<br>
    <br>
    Joe said it's kind of like a person on a playground telling a kid, hey, if you give me your twinkie I'll give you my iPod. :)<br>
    <br>
    All of these statements apply to "releasing parties" also.&nbsp; We don't want them announcing 'releasing parties' in global, but they can do that with their buddies if they want, though charging for these at all is not allowed. The big thing here is, so many people whine that someone stole their horse, or companion, or whatever their releasing when they have these 'parties'. Again, it's always good to remind them that once an item or horse leaves your possession, it is no longer considered yours and someone else catching it or picking it up is not stealing it.<br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> I've had times I've stumbled upon a releasing party, grabbed the horse, and took it to the pawneer. Might not be the nicest way to do things, but the reality that they need to face is that it will happen.<br>
    <br>
    </i><span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> I realize you want to teach the kiddos a lesson, but most will learn it from other players. I would prefer the mods were helpful and nice.. not taking horses that you know were released by a player out of good faith that it would be returned. So, if asked, please return a horse in these types of situations and be sure to let the player know that most players wouldn't return the horse so they would have lost it and to remember that once a horse is released it is no longer considered theirs.<br>

    Ignore it if it's worded all right and not causing a raucous, but do say something if they are wording it threateningly or if other players are reacting negatively.&nbsp; It's better if not mentioned at all, but it also isn't a huge deal and it's also a good idea to not make a bug fuss about it.&nbsp; Making a big deal out of it yourself, if no one else is, will just make things harder for you.<br>

    <br>
    Just seeking some clarity, normally I would copy and paste my general reminder about unfair trades, but I know from experience that its not always easy to avoid one of these situations.</i><br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod Answer:</span> Names are fine for them to give to you. As for a list of players to keep an eye on. There's probably certain players that certain mods have had run-ins with time and again. But as I recall Joe and Miranda saying they wanted the mods to treat every player equally. Not playing favorites if one player has been good, or not disliking a player for doing a bad thing. And if a player does enough bad things then Miranda and Joe will probably have noticed them because of the abuse reports.<br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> If someone comes to you and says they've been scammed, get them to file an abuse report against them. If the scamming is clear, the 'bad' player does get severe violations and could be banned. So we watch for this behavior.<br>
    There are times when a player will say they were scammed just to get another player in trouble when they were the scammer. There is no way for you to know this, so be sure to get them to file an abuse report.<br>

    <br>
    <b><a id=vq.c name=Payment_Plans></a>Payment Plans</b><br>
    Players really need to pay for something completely or not at all.&nbsp; Some set up these "payment plans" and often end up with one of the players being slighted.&nbsp; Either they gave the horse and don't ever get completely paid for it, or the person making the payments, makes a few, then the player with the horse decides not to sell it anymore, but keeps the payments that have been made up to that point.<br>
    <br>
    This is trading on a promise, so if you see someone advertising payment plans, please warn them of this problem.<br>

    <b><a id=ao41 name=Contests></a>Contests</b><br>
    Players may hold contests, such as Beauty Contests, so long as they do not charge any fee for it.&nbsp; They should use Ads Chat to advertise it.&nbsp; This is outlined in the Detailed Rules.<br>
    <br>
    <b><br>
    <a id=yd0o name=Selling_Presents></a>Selling Presents</b><br>
    This is currently in the rules:<br>
    6] Do not trade for a present because it could contain anything.<br>
    <br>
    Be sure to quote that if a player is selling presents. If the player selling them seems to be claiming there is a lot of good stuff in the presents then they really need to stop or be more honest because we all know they are mostly filled with cheap stuff. Also, they cannot claim there is money, pawneer orders, companions or horses in there since those cannot be wrapped.<br>
    <br>
    Technically, the presents are not really a raffle because the player is getting something for their money, it just probably won't be worth what they paid. Take it as a good lesson to the kids that decide to buy the present. Just watch how the player selling them is claiming what is in them.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><a id=mxdr name=Selling_Pawneer_Orders></a>Selling Pawneer Orders</b><br>
    It's better for a player to gift Pawneer Orders instead of having it in their inventory. They just need to follow the policy in the Detailed Rules under "Selling Gift Subscriptions". That is actually safer than doing it via one in their inventory. In that case, they have to make the horse, then hope that the person still wants the horse and will pay for it. Which, if the person decides they don't want the horse anymore, or it's not the right height, then the person with the Pawneer Order is stuck with a horse they don't want.<br>

    <b><a id=i2b: name=Chatspeak></a>Chatspeak</b><br>
    The main thing here is to just not over-mod. Most people can't stand it, but it's another thing that isn't that big of a deal and I don't want you guys over fretting about it. Now, if there is a player that is continually chatting in a way that is basically impossible to understand, then, by all means, deal with them. If you have someone saying "Did u want it 2?" Or something like that, where it's really simple and easily understood, don't worry too much. And the more other players get upset about it, the less that player will be able to actually chat using chat speak.<br>
    <br>
    As much as I also can't stand chat speak, I just don't want you guys to make things more difficult for yourselves or the players.<br>

    One important thing with the languages (why we require English) is because the filters don't catch foreign languages.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with discrimination. The game is made in English so they need to speak English. If you try and make the player(s) understand -why- something is a rule, it generally helps.<br>

    It has come to my attention that maybe we should have a general policy on telling players answers to quests. This includes informing players how to get to islands.<br>
    I have no problem with you telling players whatever you want, but this is another thing that should be done in pm so as not to spoil it for others. Feel free to give hints I guess if there are a number of people asking (such as, check out the new available quests, if it's a new isle that just opened), otherwise best to leave answers to things like how to get to islands (at least the smaller ones where you have to talk to someone specific to get there) in pm.<br>
    <br>
    Do not feel the need to police this in global too much. I guess it's similar to passwords and riddles in global, but no need to mute for it, just explain to the players that some people like to find out that stuff on their own.<br>
    <br>
    Some mods and players have directions to isles in their profile.&nbsp; That is just fine.<br>

    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod:</span> So I'm noticing something of a trend: players claiming they're going to harm themselves, or worse, to mods. This has happened to a fellow Pally mod, and I remember someone awhile back mentioning a similar problem on their server, here in the mod forum.<br>
    <br>
    Now I realize that there is not much we can do as mods, and I realize that alot of this is just to get attention. However, I take suicide threats very seriously. In the past I have given friends the number for the national suicide hotline. Would giving out the number be an appropriate move for a moderator to take, if we had reason to believe a player was serious in their threats? Or is this overstepping the bounds of what a moderator does? I have done no such thing, but I am disturbed at the threats of suicide and/or self-harm.<br>
    <br>
    What would be the best way to handle such threats?</i><br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod1 Answer:</span> I have to say that with the vast majority who say something like that, my line is this (in PM of course)<br>
    <br>
    "I am assuming that what you have said is a very, very bad joke. If for any reason I thought you were serious, my next action would have to be to give you a prolonged mute on this game and refer you to some suitable help and counseling sites. Am I right in thinking this is a joke?"<br>
    <br>
    To date, every single person has backtracked and said they weren't serious. Most have then claimed it's their little brother/dog/friend/aliens at the keyboard and they didn't say it.<br>
    <br>
    I've also noticed that the word seems to be getting round that this is my response as I rarely seem to see this sort of thing when I'm online.<br>
    <br>
    I have no idea if this is the best way to handle it, it's well outside my experience. It seems to work. That's all I can say.<br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod2 Answer:</span> I think that muting the player right away and chatting with them privately could help the situation. Then they can't keep talking about it in global and continue making the new trend popular.<br>
    If they really want someone to talk to, they can talk with you instead of scaring younger players in global. I think after a few minutes, if even that long, you'll be able to tell if the player is depressed or just attention seeking. If they are depressed, you can encourage them to seek help or talk to a parent or trusted teacher/counselor- if they are attention seeking you can explain the severity of these "threats" and keep them muted as a punishment for not taking it seriously and worrying other players needlessly. But I really liked [Mod1's] response a lot. I'll use that phrase myself if I run across it.<br>

    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod1:</span> I know this has been briefly mentioned before, but I know I can speak for most of the frequent Roan mods, we've been having problems with a few 'mini mods' in global. It's gone beyond just trying to be helpful. One player in particular even goes as far as saying 'I think I speak for the mods...', and jumps in when we're trying to do our job, clearly, in global already. I think its beyond these players being helpful, and them truly being a pest, because it continues even after we ask them to let us do our job.<br>
    <br>
    There was also a complaint today that if we reprimand these mini mods, its eliminating peoples chances of getting noticed to be a mod... That's not the case... I just feel that some of these players are doing it outright to annoy us...what should we do?</i><br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> What players don't realize is that being an over assertive 'mini mod' can actually hurt their chances of being a mod. Even if another mod recommends them and I see them actually tending to cause problems because of trying to act 'modly' I won't make them a mod.<br>
    <br>
    I don't look at players that act like mods. I look at players that are helpful in the sense of being willing to answer questions when asked, always answering things politely, often with a smile, deal with hard situations without getting upset, etc.<br>
    <br>
    In the case where you are having problems with players acting like mods, be sure to pm them and explain that you are handling it and what they are doing is actually causing more problems. If they get rude or continue, then go ahead and mute for 5 like [Mod2] mentioned and try to explain to them again. If you are consistently having problems with the same player(s) let me know and I can try looking into them and maybe talking to them.<br>
    <br>
    Here is [Mod2]'s post for reference:<br>
    <i>I would give the player(s) a talking to first, then, if that didn't help the situation, I'd do a short mute, maybe 5-10 min. I'd explain that it's good to be helpful, but to not step in and try to take charge of a mod's duties, especially when there are mods present. Also, make sure they know mods pm players if issues arise, not mention them in global. .<br>
    <br>
    I had a similar discussion with a few players a while back. One just couldn't wrap her mind around why it was bad. I borrowed a page from my hubby, who's a cop. I told the players to think about it this way: If you're standing next to a police officer, and the officer is telling a person who is misbehaving not to do something, and then you, a regular person, also fuss at the misbehaving person, then you're just making the situation worse, because there is someone there whose actual job is to take care of things, and he (or she) is doing it. I could almost hear the light bulbs going on over the players' heads. :) Worked great. Feel free to steal if it works for you guys.</i><br>
    <br>
    I'm seeing mods jump on some people for something that seems pretty petty... Let me try to clarify what I see as 'mini-modding'. If any of you want to add to it, feel free, say why, or what harm it causes and we'll see.<br>
    <br>
    When a player is constantly correcting people:<br>
    "<i>Use ads chat ________</i>"<br>
    "<i>Stop spamming!!</i>"<br>
    "<i>Stop talking about that ___</i>_" &lt;- the player should PM a mod and ask them to get the person to stop<br>
    "<i>Don't use caps like that.</i>"<br>
    "<i>Don't share riddles!!</i>"<br>
    etc. I think you get the point<br>
    <br>
    What I consider to NOT be mini-modding but simply helping:<br>
    "<i>Use the library to find characters in the game.</i>"<br>
    "<i>Using ads chat will probably increase the chance of you being able to sell your horse</i>!"<br>
    "<i>Ads chat is used by either selecting it in the drop down box or typin /$</i>"<br>
    "<i>You can find the password by talking to the residents.</i>"<br>
    etc.<br>
    <br>
    It's really important to distinguish between people that are just helping and answering questions, and those that are actually causing problems because they are telling people what to do. If you see someone as a mini-mod, but other players don't seem to have a problem, then leave it alone. The only time you should talk to someone that is acting like a mini-mod is if they are actually causing more fighting in global.<br>

    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod3 Answer:</span> A mini mod is someone who decides to reprimand players after every little infraction and not allowing the mods time to even respond or still post it after we say something.<br>
    <br>
    Lastly, please do not tell other players they are being 'mini-mods' or they are 'mini-modding'. The best thing to do if someone keeps correcting others in global is to PM them and say something like "I know you are trying to help, but please let the mods handle it. We do so in PM and we don't want a(the) player feeling bombarded". Or something like that.<br>
    <br>
    Calling a player a 'mini-mod' or saying that they are 'mini-modding' is basically name calling and many take offense to it. If you let them know that we handle things in PM and talk with each other to be sure a player isn't bombarded then maybe they will be less prone to attempt to get players to follow the rules in the future.<br>

    <b><a id=p5gl name=Harassment_of_Mods></a>Harassment of Mods</b><br>
    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod1:</span> This evening [actually, it's still going on as I post this] a few of the known "troublemakers" on Bay server were harassing and being extremely disrespectful towards 2 of the 3 mods [both of us being new]. It was asked repeatedly that players drop this and keep their comments to themselves, but they refused, and continued saying rude/hurtful things. I do not know what is to be done about this. If I do something to reprimand them, I don't think it will help the situation, but I do not feel it should go unpunished. I considered muting for 15 minutes in regards to teasing, but wasn't sure if this was the proper thing to do. Please help!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know most of these players are children. It almost sickens me to see the actions of some players. It's amazing what the internet can do for a person. Leaves them safe to be rude and hurtful, even if they wouldn't do it in everyday life. Provides them with something to hide behind - leaves them anonymous. It's sad, and I actually feel bad for them. I try not to take it too personally, but it's hard not to. There's someone openly saying to 80 other players that they HATE you. Not dislike, but HATE. I actually don't think I've ever said that to anyone in my LIFE. Ugh.<br>
    </i><br style=COLOR:#990000>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> For these types of things they need to be muted. Especially if they are doing it in global and not stopping after being asked to. By not muting them, they think they can get away with it. They probably would start harassing you after you mute them, but you can always personally mute them.<br>
    <br>
    Just remember that the anonymity applies to you also. They don't know who you are or what you're really like, so what they say doesn't really have any bearing on you. It's really important to ignore these types of hurtful things and not take it personally, though I know that can be tough.<br>

    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod2 Answer:</span> When I first started dispatching my trainer told me the best piece of advice I have ever heard. As it is highly applicable here I want to share it :)<br>
    She said " It's never personal! Unless someone says to you - Hey! You - so and so (insert name) I know you! I know where you live and how you live your life! I know how you treat your family and your kids and I just want you to know that I hate you and I think you suck at the way you live your life! - Unless a caller, or an officer (or a PLAYER), can say that to you - it's never personal.<br>
    <br>
    <i><span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod1:</span> Okay so here's the deal. On Roan during more than one instance I've noticed different moderators trying to remind a player of certain rules and instead of the usual 'my bad' they get backtalk from the players. It seems to me that more and more players are viewing certain mods as being "power hungry" and that mods "discretely lord their power over us [players] by boosting their egos with mutes" when they're only trying to do their job.</i><br>
    <br>
    <span style=COLOR:#990000>Answer:</span> Telling the player to file an abuse report if they feel they've been treated unfairly is probably the best thing you can do. You should also let them know that starting disputes in global is against the rules.<br>
    However, if they don't take that hint and continue to make a dispute in global then I'd say muting is definitely in order.<br>
    <br style=COLOR:#38761d>
    <span style=COLOR:#38761d>Mod3 Answer:</span> This is going to sound dumb. But I definitely up the amount of smiley faces I use when asking players to follow rules through PM's. If they argue about it I will remind them that the rules are there for a reason, also with a smiley face.<br>
    <br>
    Example: A player keeps using global chat instead of ads chat for their selling ads.<br>
    Me: Please remember to keep that in Ads Chat Please :)<br>
    Player: But I can only post once per minute with ads chat!<br>
    Me: That's true, but ads chat is there to keep the global clutter down and it is a rule to keep all advertisements in that chat. Thanks :)<br>
    <br>
    The player will usually just say "okay" after that point and use ads chat. If not, I mute for 5 mins.</font>
