Expected Behavior for Players, Moderators, and Admins on Horse Isle.&nbsp;
Following these guidelines will help promote a fun game experience for all.<br/>
<br/>

<br style="FONT-STYLE:italic"/>
</span></font><font color="#990000"><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic"><font color="#000000" style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Purpose:</font>
To enjoy the game.</span></font><br/>
<br/>
Do NOT ruin the enjoyment of Horse Isle by another player through negative
actions of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
If harassed/upset/annoyed by another player, use the MUTE system to mute the
other player,&nbsp; DO NOT make things worse by fighting with another
player,&nbsp; this is considered to be both players faults regardless of who
started it.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT threaten to report players.&nbsp; If you have a problem with another
player use the MUTE system and if it's serious, then file an abuse report.&nbsp;
There is no need to tell them or threaten them.&nbsp; Threatening another player
with an abuse report, especially when the other player did nothing wrong could
easily get you in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT be offended when a player Mutes you,&nbsp; anyone can Mute anyone for any
reason.&nbsp; Some people are not as "talkative" as others and don't appreciate
being chatted to much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just try to find others that appreciate
chatting with you.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT be offended or upset if a player does not answer your Private
Message.&nbsp; Many players may be away from the game for a bit or are busy
doing something else.&nbsp; Replying to PM's can be a lot of work depending on
the situation the player is in.<br/>
<br/>
Players should reply positively when possible.&nbsp; If you have nothing
positive/helpful to say,&nbsp; please just do not reply.<br/>
<br/>
Players should never cheat/lie/trick another player into making an unfair trade.
Stealing horses, money, etc. in this manner is an instant BAN.<br/>
<br/>
Players are 100% responsible for their accounts.&nbsp; Do not let siblings use
your account and do not give out your password to ANYONE.<br/>
<br/>
Players should always respect moderators when they ask you to do
something.&nbsp; If you feel a moderator is not being fair, or violating
moderator expected behavior below, you can email us directly.&nbsp; In the mean
time, respect the moderator.<br/>
<br/>
<B>Note:</B> When the horses have a bridle on it shows the reins hanging down.  This was for drawing/fitting purposes only.  Please never leave your own, real life horse with its reins hanging down in this manner.  It is very dangerous for your horse.<br/>

<font color="#990000" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Moderators:</span></font><font color="#990000"><br/>
<font color="#000000"><br style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"/>
</font><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic"><font color="#000000"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">
Purpose:</span></font> To have mature, positive players who can be trusted to
quell bad/rule violating behavior from within the game.</span></font><br/>
<br/>
Moderators should be a good role model of all Expected Player Behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Moderators should be fair in any use of moderator abilities.&nbsp; Never used
for personal reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Moderators are not required to help other players.&nbsp; Moderators are players
like everyone else. Sometimes they are busy, or working on their own things.
Moderators are under no obligation to help.&nbsp; DO NOT be upset when they do
not have time to help you, and be grateful when they do.&nbsp; Try making your
requests for help to anyone on the server if it's a general game issue.<br/>
<br/>
When to Prison Isle: This is the least severe of Moderator actions.&nbsp; Mostly
done if a player is physically being in the way of others in the game, or
harassing, etc..&nbsp;&nbsp; No Violation Points are assigned for this.<br/>
<br/>
When to Mute: In any case where a player is not following Horse Isle Rules after
being asked to follow the specific rule they are violating.&nbsp; Muting should
happen right away when a player is purposefully and seriously violating
profanity rules, etc. Mute times may range from 5 minutes to 2 full days
depending on severity.&nbsp;&nbsp; An Admin will review each muting case and
assign Violation points if warranted.<br/>
<br/>
When to Delete player/horse/ranch Profiles: When a clear violation of Personally
identifiable info is present such as age/phone/address/im/email/etc. (Real life
information on the players horses, or other non-identifiable info is
acceptable).&nbsp; Also, any&nbsp; profanity/filter avoidance is cause for
profile deletion.&nbsp; When profiles are deleted, they are reviewed by an admin
and violation points assigned based on content.<br/>
<br/>
When to Ban: Two Moderators need to agree to ban a player in order for it to
work.&nbsp; This should only be used on SEVERE Cases where MUTES do not solve
the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or where a new player has connected with a clearly
offensive name.<br/>
<br/>
Moderators need to PM players when there is a problem.&nbsp; Such as when a
player is spamming, begging, causing troubles, etc.&nbsp; This causes the player
to not be singled out in global.&nbsp; It also tends to help contain the
situation better and keep it from escalating into something worse.<br/>
<br/>
Moderators are not required to go to a different server even if there are not
any moderators there.<br/>
<br/>
It's great for moderators to have buddies, but they must not be treated as
favorites.&nbsp; This means the friends of moderators should be treated the same
as any other player with regard to punishment for not following the rules.&nbsp;
Moderators found 'playing favorites' could have their moderator privileges taken
away.<br/>
<br/>
<font color="#990000" size="4"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Admins:</span></font><font color="#990000"><br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-STYLE:italic"><font color="#000000" style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">
Purpose:</font> To make sure the moderators are being fair, balanced, and
positive role-models.&nbsp; To make final situational judgements.&nbsp; To judge
abuse reports. etc.&nbsp; Our main goal is to ensure an environment where all
players of any age can enjoy themselves.</span></font><br/>
<br/>
Admins should be fair, and uphold the rules set forth.<br/>
<br/>
Being fair requires being strict.&nbsp; When too many violations occur,&nbsp; We
MUST remove accounts and block game access in more serious cases.&nbsp; We
cannot take excuses of siblings being responsible, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each player
is responsible for what happens on their account.<br/>
