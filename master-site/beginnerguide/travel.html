<P><IMG SRC="dock.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=226 BORDER=0>Since
there are so many islands here, travelling by ship is a routine
occurrence. You will find docks on all the large islands, and some of
the smaller ones.</P>
<P>It will be a very good idea for you to keep notes on which docks
have ships going to which islands, because no dock has ships which go
to every other dock. The cost of trips depends upon how far away your
destination is. Trips are one way only.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="wagon.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=147 BORDER=0>You
can also travel, on some islands, by wagon.  Wagon fares are much
cheaper than boat fares, but only one wagon route crosses water. 
Still, they are very useful for getting around on large islands.</P>
<P>Some NPC's (non-player characters) have the power to teleport or
&quot;jump&quot; you from one location to another.  Make sure you
write down the names and locations of these people when you find
them; they are very useful!</P>
