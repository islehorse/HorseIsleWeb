<P>Horse Isle is the home to literally thousands of horses of many
different breeds, sizes, types and colors. Once you have arrived on
Horse Isle, the first thing you'll want to do is get a horse of your
own. Before you can do this, though, you will need money to buy it,
tack it up, get it groomed and shod and keep it fed, watered and
healthy. Just as in real-life, horse-keeping is not inexpensive!

a Horse</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>There are several ways to acquire a horse on Horse Isle.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="leasing_pen.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=176 BORDER=0><B>Leasing.</B>
If you are a brand new player, this is probably the best option for
you, until you earn a bit of money. There are two hack stables (also
known as livery stables, rental barns and so on, depending upon where
you live) on Horse Isle: one in the town of Earton (the first town
you will encounter when you debark the boat from Welcome Isle), and
one in Appleton, a town on the southern end of Horse Isle.</P>
<P>Leasing stables look like small paddocks (at left), and will rent
out a horse for one game day (2 real hours) for a nominal fee. These
horses are already tacked up, groomed and shod; but since they are
not your own, you may not enter competitions with them, nor shoe nor
do many of the other things you can do with a horse of your own.
Also, when you lease, you lease whatever breed of horse is available;
you do not get to choose. So consider wisely whether you would like
to lease a horse at first, or save your money to buy one of your own
(remember that you will need to buy tack as well before you can
ride).</P>
<P><B>Buying directly from another player. </B>Players have horses
for sale all the time, and these will be of all breeds, colors and
sizesâ€”and ranges of experience and training. Watch the chat windows
to see who is selling what. Prices for horses vary considerably, but
on the whole, the more training a horse has (the "higher its
stats" as players will say) the more expensive the horse. Some
breeds, such as the Thoroughbred, are always very expensive to buy.
Other breeds are extremely expensive to buy when the breed has just
been introduced; but if you wait a few weeks, the prices invariably
plummet as Dame Fashion turns her attention elsewhere.</P>
<P><B>Buying a horse at Auction.</B> There are numerous auction
blocks on Horse Isle, but the ones in Earton are by far the most
popular. No direct negotiations with owners are needed at the
auction; just don't get carried away and bid more than you can
afford!</P>
<P><IMG SRC="horseshere.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=216 BORDER=0><B>Catching
a wild horse.</B> Wild horses are rare in the Isles, but generally a
player can find one or two a day. Different players have "favorite
islands" for catching wild horses, and some breeds can only be
found in some areas: Arabians, Akhal-Tekes and Australian Brumbies
can only be found in the desert; Norwegian Fjords, Icelandics and
Exmoors can only be found on snowy isles; Mules are only in forests,
and Pasos only in Jungle. Other breeds can be found randomly on any
isle, and in Horse Isle, no breed is rarer than any other.</P>
<P>When you come upon a wild horse, you will see a notification in
the <A HREF="mainscreen.html">Dialog Window</A> telling you that you
have found a horse, and the breed the horse is. You cannot know what
gender or color the horse is until you have caught it.</P>
<P>To catch the horse, click the capture button. A Mini-Game will
appear on the screen.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="catch.jpg"  ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=219 BORDER=0>In
order to catch the horse, use the mouse to pull out and position the
noose around the horse's neck. Some players feel that it's easiest to
"throw" the rope in front of the horse and let him run into
it. Releasing the mouse button captures the horse, if the horse and
rope are both in the proper position.</P>
<P>Wild horses are wily! They run slow and then fast, they switch
back and then switch back again, they spin, stop and run. And the
rope will not stay stretched out more than a few seconds! It can be
difficult to catch a wild horse, but with some practice you'll become
an expert!</P>
<P>Unless the horse is one that another player has released, it will
have no experience points. This means it will buck you off when it
gets frustrated. As in real life, just get right back on! A horse
gets one experience point each time it bucks, and it will stop
bucking when it reaches 25.</P>
