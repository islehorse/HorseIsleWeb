Player Hint Guide: THE MAIN SCREEN</FONT></H1>
<P>This is the screen in which you play the game. It has many
interesting areas, all of which you should become familiar with.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="mainscreen.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=671 HEIGHT=506 BORDER=0>The
<B>GAME WINDOW</B> is where all the visual action takes place. You
will always be in the center of this window.</P>
<P>The <B>DIALOG WINDOW</B> tells you where you are (In Earton on
Horse Isle in this case), what is at the same spot you are on, and
many other things as they come up.</P>
<P>Directly below these windows is the <B>BUTTON PANEL</B>. Clicking
on any of these buttons gives you different information about various
aspects of the game:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>STATS</B> gives you your personal statistics: how tired,
	hungry and thirsty you are, what you are wearing, what awards you
	have won, how many quests you have finished, and so on.</P>
	<LI><P><B>INVENTORY</B> shows what you are carrying with you. Unless
	you have a ranch with a shed, you can carry 40 different kinds of
	items, and 50 items of each kind.</P>
	<LI><P><B>PLAYERS</B> gives you some information on the other
	players who are playing at the same time you are. You can see who
	they are, find them on a map, look at the horses in their stable,
	and send them a private message. Players with single stars next to
	their names are monthly subscribers; double stars have subscribed
	for three months, and red-centered stars have subscribed for a year.
	Green stars with an M inside denote game Moderators (Mods), and red
	stars with an A are game Administrators (Admins).</P>
	<LI><P><B>PROFILE</B> allows you to change your user icon and what
	you have written about yourself in your player profile.</P>
	<LI><P><B>MAP</B> is a very interesting and extremely useful
	feature. The Map will always show you where you are on the isles.
	You can find the names of other places by holding the mouse cursor
	over the place whose name you want to know. At the bottom of this
	page is a map with most of the islands labelled.</P>
	<LI><P><B>HELP</B> brings up a quick run-down of the game in the
	Dialog Window.</P>
	<LI><P><B>QUIT GAME</B> saves all your settings and gets you out of
	the game cleanly. Always end a game by using the quit button to
	avoid losing any data!</P>
</UL>
<P>The <B>GLOBAL CHAT WINDOW</B> will show chat from any game
character, and whatever is in this window is seen by all players. It
will also show you who has logged in and who has disconnected. The
<B>PERSONAL CHAT WINDOW</B> shows chat that only your buddies, or a
single person of your choice, can see. Below this is is the chat menu
and type-in area. These will be discussed more thoroughly on the <A HREF="chat.html">Chat</A>
page. This window also shows <A HREF="quests.html">quest</A> progress
and in-game news, so watch it carefully as you play, even if you are
not chatting.</P>
<P>To the right of the SEND button is the Wrench/Spanners icon for
your <B>TOOLKIT</B>. The toolkit contains a binoculars, magnifying
glass, rake and shovel, as well as a volume control for game
background music, a &quot;Low Detail&quot; control (for eliminating
some special effects when playing during peak hours, to make it run
slightly faster), and buttons for clearing the chat windows.</P>
<P>Below all of this is the name of the server you are on, how much
money you have on hand, how many players are online, how much mail
you have waiting for you at City Hall and the current game time and
date. Clicking the four white squares allows you to change the
background melody to a random tune. The FPS number (Frames Per
Second) is a measure of how fast the game is running on your
computer. Twenty-four frames per second is as fast as it will go;
anything higher than 20 is excellent speed.</P>
