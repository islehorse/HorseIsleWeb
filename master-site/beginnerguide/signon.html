<P><IMG SRC="loginscreen.jpg"  ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=465 BORDER=0>When
you first visit the Horse Isle page, you will see the page at right.
In order to create an account, several steps are required.</P>
<P>The first thing to do is to <B>check your version of Flash</B> to
make sure you have the most up-to-date version.  Trying to run Horse
Isle on an older version of Flash is a very vexing experience.  If
you can see the scene in the window and hear the background music,
you have the latest version (Flash Player 9 at the time of this
writing).  If you cannot see and/or hear, you will need to <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/">download
the latest Flash Player</A> for your system.  (Horse Isle itself is
system independent and will run on all platforms supported by Flash).</P>
<P>To sign in, click <B>Create an Account.</B>  Once you do this, you
will be given an overview of the game rules, and then asked to answer
some questions to make sure you have read and understood them, and
agree to abide by them.  If you do not agree to abide by the game
rules, you will not be allowed to sign in!  Once you do sign in, you
are responsible for keeping your word and obeying the rules to which
you have agreed.</P>
<P>You will then be required to choose a user name. <B>Your real name
is not allowed as a user name,</B> not now, not later, not ever,
never. AmyBCloony is not allowed; and you probably shouldn't even use
just "Amy." Make up a name that does not contain a real
name, such as Amabarl, or use something descriptive such as
VinylRecord. Whatever name you choose it should be something you will
remember!</P>
<P>User names which are real names, or user names which contain
profanity of <I>any</I> kind will be immediately banned by the
<A HREF="mods.html">Moderators</A>. 
</P>
<P><B>Passwords</B> must consist of both letters and numerals. An
acceptable password might be a1b2c3d4. Whatever it is, it should be
both something you will find easy to remember and something difficult
(or, hopefully, impossible) for other people to guess. <B><I>Never,
but NEVER, give your password to anyone under any circumstances! </I></B>You
will be held responsible for anything another person does while
logged into your account.</P>
<P>You will also be asked to give us a <B>VALID email address.</B> 
If you are under 13 years of age, you must give us one of your
parents' or guardians' email addresses.  In order for you to continue
playing, you will need to click an activation link in an email we
will send you (or your parents will need to click it in their email)
so that we know we have a valid address for you.</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800000">ABSOLUTELY NO MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT PER
PLAYER!  </FONT></B>Multiple accounts are not allowed and players
with more than one account will have ALL accounts deleted!</P>
