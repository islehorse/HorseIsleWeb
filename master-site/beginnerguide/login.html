<P><B>Servers.</B> When you first log in to Horse Isle, your first
choice will be which server you wish to be connected to. (A <B>server</B>
is a computer which "serves" files to other computers; the
various Horse Isle servers "serve" the game, via the
internet, to your own computer.) When Horse Isle first "went
live," there was only one server, which later became known as
"Pinto" as more servers were added. Each server can handle
about 150 players at a time. You may log into any server you might
like, but we do recommend that new players log on to the newest
server where there is more room to accommodate them. Scroll down the
server list and you will see which server is the newest.</P>
<P>The server lists will tell you how many other players are online on each server. It also tells you
important game information such as your bank balance, how much cash
you have on hand, and how many quest points you have earned so far.</P>
<P>From time to time, a pink box will appear at the top of the server
list. This will contain news about new additions to the game and
other important information. <B>Be sure to read this carefully!</B></P>
<P>Once you log in to a server, you will be directed to another
screen which gives you more information about the current state of
the game.</P>
