Player Hint Guide: MODERATORS (MODS)</FONT></H1>
<P>From time to time you will see a comment in <B><FONT COLOR="#198533">GREEN</FONT></B>
text; this is a comment from a Game Moderator, or &quot;Mod.&quot;</P>
<P>Moderators are players chosen by the game developers to act as
mediators, enforce the game rules, and generally keep the game
running smoothly for everyone. Mods are chosen on the basis of their
maturity, both physically (most are parents and some are
grandparents!) and mentally, and their ability to arbitrate and
enforce fairly and without favoritism. (Contrary to rumors you may
have heard, Mods are not paid to moderate, nor do they receive any
benefits whatsoever; they are all volunteers who just enjoy the
game).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>WHAT
MODS DO</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Mostly, Mods just try to play the game and have a good time.
Generally, however, Mods are busy answering player questions,
resolving disputes and enforcing the chat rules. Moderators have the
authority to send a player to Prison Isle or MUTE a player (take away
their ability to chat with, or receive chat from, other players)
depending upon the infraction. Mods may also ban players whose
behavior is particularly offensive. These are all judgment calls that
Mods make, and, like umpires in a baseball game, arguing is not
permitted. (If you have read the game rules and follow them as you
agreed to when you joined, however, you should never find yourself in
this situation.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>WHAT
MODS DON'T DO</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Moderators are only game facilitators. They are not libraries,
banks or horse farms. Very few, if any, mods will give you the
answers to game riddles, although some may give you further clues if
they are not busy with questions from other players. Moderators
<I>cannot </I>give you money or horses, nor can they send you to any
place in the game apart from Prison.</P>
<P>Another thing Mods DON'T do is value horses for sale. Please do
not ask the moderators how much a horse is worth; they have no more
idea than you do and no time to research this point. A horse is worth
what others will payâ€”nothing more or less.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>DEALING
WITH MODS</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>If you a want a mod to contact you for some reason, just PM
(private message) one. In that message, clearly state your problem.
Then, wait. Most of the time, Mods cannot get back to you immediately
because they are dealing with other players; you will have to wait
your turn. PMing &quot;Are you there?&quot; repeatedly is rude.</P>
<P>If a mod mutes you for a violation of the rules, DO NOT threaten
them in any way. Use the mute time to get your quests done, travel or
bank or eat or care for your horses, and then go on about your
business. Arguing only results in your being muted for even longer
periods of time.</P>
<P>If a mod gives you an answer you don't want to hear, please don't
immediately run and ask the same question of another mod.  Mods do
chat amongst themselves...</P>
<P>New mods generally find that once they become a moderator, they
are now prime targets for buddy-collectors.  Most mods do not accept
buddies, and many only keep a few of the buddies they had before they
became mods.  They do this so as not to appear to have favorites, and
not because they don't like you.  Our moderators take their duties
very seriously.</P>
<P>Remember that mods are players too; they are not required to
answer your questions or help you in any way; that they do, when they
can, shows their commitment to the game and in everyone's enjoyment
of it.</P>
