Player Hint Guide: MONEY AND BANKING</FONT></H1>
<P>The very first thing you will need to do on Horse Isle is earn
some money. You'll need it for food and lodging for yourself and your
horses, buying tack, entering competitions and paying for travel.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>MAKING
MONEY. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>The best way to make money is to do <A HREF="quests.html">quests</A>.
Visit each house and shop, and talk to the people who live and work
there. The vast majority will have things they need done for them,
for which they will pay very well. Some people need things delivered;
some people have lost things and need them found for them. Some
quests are very simple and others extremely difficult; more about
that on the Quests page.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="store.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=221 BORDER=0>As
you walk around Horse Isle, you will step on and over all kinds of
things you can grab and put into your inventory. All of these things
can be sold. 
</P>
<P>Most of them can be sold to the various shops in the towns. All
the shops in Horse Isle will buy the same kinds of things they sell.
General Stores will buy food items, some articles of clothing, some
miscellaneous horse items, etc. Rock Stores will buy the various ores
and gems you will find. Food stores will buy the berries, apples,
acorns and other edibles you come across.</P>
<P>Stores generally buy items for about half of what they sell the
same items for, and different stores have different prices. As you
travel around Horse Isle, keep notes on which stores sell for the
least and buy for the most.</P>
<P>Items which cannot be sold in stores can usually be sold to
individual NPCs throughout the game. Search for these people by going
into the houses and talking to them, and seeing what they want. Keep
notes on who buys what, and for how much.</P>
<P>Money can also be made by trading/selling items and horses to
other players. However, you must be very careful when doing this.
Remember, we are, and ought to be, all strangers to each other on
Horse Isle. Sad as it is to say, not everyone can be trusted to make
a fair deal. More on this in the section on Horses.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="bank.jpg" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=19 VSPACE=10 WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=221 BORDER=0><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>GROWING
MONEY. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>Once you have made some money, it is highly recommended that you
deposit as much of it as you can in the local banks.  The Horse Isle
banks pay interest on money you deposit, and the more money you have
in the bank, the more interest you will accrue.  You can deposit as
much or as little as you want, and you can withdraw any amount of
money whenever you need it.  All the Horse Isle banks are connected,
so you have access to your money at all the banks in whichever city
you find yourself.</P>
<P>One last note:  <B>Never, never, NEVER give anyone money for
nothing!</B>  Also, never give "down-payments" on anything,
as unfortunately a player who asks for a down-payment on something is
unlikely ever to be seen again!  <B><FONT COLOR="#800000">If this
